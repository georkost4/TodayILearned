# Creating prototypes

The process of going from an idea to a product is a messy one. Learning how to prototype your idea, getting feedback, and iterating on it is the most critical skill anyone aspiring to build their own products should have. This is also one of the most significant parts of a UX Designer’s job.


## What is Rapid Prototyping?

When used well, rapid prototyping will improve the quality of your designs by enhancing communication between the various parties and reducing the risk of building something that no one wants.

## The Rapid Prototyping Process
Rapid Prototyping involves a three-step process, repeated as many times as needed:

1. Prototype: Create a visual mock-up of your solution or interface.
2. Review: Share the prototype with users and evaluate if it meets their needs and expectations.
3. Refine: Based on this feedback, identify areas that need to be improved or clarified.

A prototype will usually start with a very simple mock-up of key areas and become more complex with each iteration as you gather more data from user feedback.

## How much should you include in your prototype?

Prototype *one User Flow at a time*. Instead of going screen by screen, base your prototype on a story that will take the user through the areas that you want to prototype. 

## Visual (Sketched vs. Styled)

If a prototype is produced with a high level of visual fidelity from the beginning, users will tend to focus on visual rather than functional details

## Content (Lorem ipsum(dummy text) vs. real content)
In the early stages of prototyping, standard “lorem ipsum” content can be useful to avoid distracting the user so they can focus on providing functional feedback instead of commenting on changes in the text.

However, as the prototyping process continues, evaluate the need to replace dummy text with real content so users can get a feel for how it affects the overall design.

## What fidelity levels exist?
1. Low-Fidelity: Low-Fi methods like pencil-and-paper sketches produce static prototypes with low visual and content fidelity that allow for quick and easy changes. 

2. Medium-Fidelity: Computer-based tools like Visio produce what we can call medium-fidelity prototypes in the form of wireframes and workflows.

3. High-Fidelity: High-fidelity prototypes can sometimes be so realistic that they are often mistaken for the real product. They are also much more time-consuming to produce. Tools like InVision, Sketch, Figma, Adobe XD, Framer.
