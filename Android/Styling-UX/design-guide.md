# Step by Step guide for UX Design

## User Goals

A user goal is what the user is trying to achieve. For freeCodeCamp, the user’s goal **is to learn web programming** so that they can start making web apps. For Uber’s user, the goal **is to find a cab** to get to a destination. 

There are usually multiple user goals within an application: we will break each of these goals into a list of tasks that the user must accomplish to achieve their goal.

## Task Lists
Once you’ve identified a user goal, you can start breaking it down into a list of tasks that the user must accomplish to complete the goal successfully. For finding an Uber, a task list would look as follows:

1. Open the Uber app.
2. Enter a destination in the “Where to?” box on top.
3. Pick the type of Uber you want (Pool, uberX, SELECT, BLACK, uberXL, SUV, etc.)
4. Make sure the Payment method is the one you desire to pay with.
5. Press the Confirm button.
6. Confirm the pickup spot.
7. Wait for the car, take the ride, get dropped off at your destination.
8. Review and tip.


## User Flow Diagrams
Given a task list, you can convert it into a User Flow Diagram to show how a user will move through your app. User Flow Diagrams help you reason about how the application will work before you start any prototyping/building. It’s the same as the task list, except it’s a flowchart that uses symbols and arrows to communicate the task list more visually.

## Feedback

Take feedback from your users using  *Empathy Map* and *User Journey Maps* to create a user persona .
