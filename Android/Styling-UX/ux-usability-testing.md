# The  secret behind great UX: Usability Testing

Whether you only have a prototype or a full-fledged product, it’s a really good idea to run monthly usability tests. These make sure that whatever you’re working on is usable and the user experience is excellent.

First off, always keep the **two Golden Rules of Usability Testing** in mind:

1. Any testing is better than no testing (with no one!)
2. A little testing earlier is better than a lot of testing later.

## A quick intro to usability testing
The idea behind this is to:

1. Find a few participants
2. Ask them to come in and go through a list of user flows you want to test
3. Observe the problems they run into
4. Finally, make a list of issues to fix

Sounds simple enough, but very few of us actually do it. 

Before we get to the test itself, here are a few things to note:

1. Reserve one morning a month (say the third Thursday every month) for a round of testing, debriefing, and deciding what to fix.

2. Test with three participants each round. Most usability problems can be uncovered by testing with just about anyone.

3. You can ask your friends, your existing users, or even go to a café and ask strangers for 15 minutes of their time in exchange for buying them a coffee.

4. If you’re doing this as part of a bigger team, get as many observers as possible to observe the tests in a separate observation room.

## What happens during the test?
During a usability test, you will record the participant’s voice and their computer screen, and share both these streams live with observers in another room. A typical one-hour test can be broken down into:

1. Welcome (4 mins): Explain how the test will work so that the participant will know what to expect.

2. The questions (2 mins): Ask the participant a few questions about themselves. This helps put them at ease and gives you an idea of how computer-savvy they are.

3. The Homepage tour (3 mins): Open the Home page of your site, and ask the participant to look around and tell you what they think. This will give you an idea of how easy it is to understand your home page, as well as how familiar the participant is with your domain.

4. The tasks (35 minutes): Watch the participant perform a series of tasks you have prepared for them beforehand. Encourage the participant to think out loud as they perform the task (see the video at the end of the post for a sample test.) It’s crucial that you let them work on their own and not ask them any leading questions, or give out any clues or assistance.

5. Probing (5 mins): Ask the participant any questions you may have about anything that happened during the test and about any issues that people in the observation room may have. Also, answer any questions that the participant may have at this point (don’t answer them during the actual tasks since you’re testing how they’ll perform with no one around.)

6. Wrapping Up (5 mins): Thank them for their help, and give them their gift card if you promised one while recruiting them.

## The debrief
During the breaks between successive tests, ask the observers to write down **the top 3** usability problems that they saw. During the debriefing, focus ruthlessly on deciding to fix the most severe problems first. Here are a few other recommendations:
