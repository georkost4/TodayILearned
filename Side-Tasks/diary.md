First Entry. The things I did today was wake up in the morning.Eat breakfast , go to work and come back at 2.30pm . After that I watched an episode of Orphan Black and took a nap. Woke up at 6.30pm saw another 2-3 episodes of OB and opened my Medium Daily Digest e-mail while I finished my daily Duolingo and Mondly Spanish-Bulgarian exercises . Then I pushed this to complete my daily commit at GitHub.After that I will probably watch some more episodes of BO till I sleep.
