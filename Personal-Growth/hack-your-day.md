# The way to hack your day

## Useful Tips

### Waking up Early
The thing that I lately realized to make the most out of my day is:

1. Wake up early , say 8-8.30 a.m
2. Either go for a walk or do some handy work for about 1.5 - 2 hours.

The benefits from this two things are incredible . I always thought of resting and waking up lately would be more work - efficient but I was very wrong. Waking up early and getting your blood flow pumping with some morning exercise is exactly what you need to start your day . You will have the energy to get through all of your daily works .

So my advice **EXERCISE** to enjoy huge amounts of energy.
