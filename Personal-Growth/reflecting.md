# Reflection

> It is the language of reflection that deepens our knowledge of who we are in relation to others in a community of learners.


Reflecting the things you are learning is a very good technique that can help your brain build concrete connections to that knowledge. In fact this is what I'm doing right now writing these lines . I was just learning about Git on Udacity and the instructor said to reflect on the things we just watched/learned :smirk: .
